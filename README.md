# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT
This is a classification problem with two classes: won't buy and will buy, represented by 0s and 1s.
# Purchase Prediction Model

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer purchase behavior, classifying them into two categories: 'won't buy' (0) and 'will buy' (1).

## Introduction

Understanding customer purchase behavior is crucial for businesses aiming to enhance sales and customer satisfaction. This project employs machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on provided features.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises customer information with features relevant to purchasing decisions. It includes:

- `Audiobooks_data.csv`: Raw data file.
- `Audiobooks_data_train.npz`: Preprocessed training data.
- `Audiobooks_data_validation.npz`: Preprocessed validation data.
- `Audiobooks_data_test.npz`: Preprocessed test data.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps are documented in `Preprocessing.ipynb`. Key steps include:

- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Feature scaling.
- Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.

## Modeling

The modeling process is detailed in `Model.ipynb`. It involves:

- Selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms.
- Training models on the preprocessed data.
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

Confusion matrices and ROC curves are also utilized to assess model effectiveness.

## Usage
